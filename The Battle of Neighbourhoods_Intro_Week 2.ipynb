    "I live in Singapore, a tiny city state in South East Asia. In Singapore, food is viewed as crucial to its national identity and a unifying cultural thread. Eating is considered as a national pastime and food a national obsession. Food is a frequent topic of conversation among Singaporeans    \n",
    "  \n",
    "Indian cuisine is very popular in Singapore and like other Singaporean ethnic cuisines, Singaporean Indian cuisine has been influenced by multiple cultural groups. Dishes from both North India and South India can be found in Singapore\n",
    "As eating out is very common in Singapore, food related businesses are very profitable in Singapore.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "In Singapore, the primary mode of transport is trains, what we call as MRTs (Mass Rapid Transport). Proximity to a MRT station is key success factor to any business and so it is for food business. On a usual day couples and families meet up in their nearest MRT stations on their way back from work to grab their dinner before heading back home. "
